# template: node.ovc

## Description:
This actor template is responsible for creating a virtual machine on any openVCloud environment.

## Schema:

- description: arbitrary description of the vm. **optional**
- bootdisk.size: boot disk size in GB default:10.
- memory: memory available for the vm in GB. default:1.

> Make sure to pass a value for `memory` that matches a VM size that supports the specified `bootdisksize`.
> Check the POST /cloudapi/sizes/list Cloud API for all available VM sizes for a given cloud space (values are in MB, so multiply `memory` with 1024).

- sizeID: will override memory parameter. Denotes type of VM, this size impact the number of CPU and memory available for the vm.
- os.image: OS image to use for the VM. default:'Ubuntu 15.10'.
- ports: List of port forwards to create. Format is `Public_port:VM_port` or `VM_port`.
if the public port is not specified, it will be chosen automatically in the available ports of the vdc.
e.g: to expose port 22 of the VM to the port 9000 on the public port of the vdc use :`9000:22`. **optional**
- machine.id: once the VM is created, holds the ID return by openvcloud for that VM. **filled in automatically, don't specify it in the blueprint**
- ip.public: public IP of the VM once installed. **filled in automatically, don't specify it in the blueprint**
- ip.private: private IP of the VM inside the VDC. **filled in automatically, don't specify it in the blueprint**
- ssh.login: login used to create ssh connection to the VM. **filled in automatically, don't specify it in the blueprint**
- ssh.password: password used to create ssh connection to the vm. **filled in automatically, don't specify it in the blueprint**
- vdc: service name of the vdc service where to deploy the VM. This is the parent service. If not specified, will try to use any defined in the blueprint. **required** to be defined in the blueprint
- ovf.link: the link to owncloud e.g http://mycloud.com/remote.php/webdav/ where you want to store the exported machine
- ovf.username: username for owncloud server
- ovf.password: password for owncloud server
- ovf.path: path to put the exported machine in e.g /exported_vms/machine.ovf
- ovf.callbackUrl: callbackurl for calling you back when the machine is exported
- disk: list of disk instances to be attached to the VM
- vmHistory: stores VM history which includes the actions performed on this machine and the time these actions were performed. **filled in automatically, don't specify it in the blueprint**
- uservdc: List of users to that access the machine with the type of access rights for each user e.g 'R' for read only access, 'RCX' for Write and 'ARCXDU' for Admin
- clone.name: The name of the machine that will be created when executing the clone action.
- snapshots: The list of snapshots of the node. **filled in when executing the listSnapshots action, don't specify it in the blueprint**
- snapshot.epoch: The epoch of a snapshot to rollback or delete.
- vmInfoCallback: Callback url to send vm info after installing if succeeded or report the error to during installation.

### Changing port forwardings

 - Removing port forwarding in blueprints `section ports` will remove the portforwarding.
 - Adding new port forward in blueprint will add a new portforwarding.
 - Editing port forward in blueprint = removing the old portforward and creating new one.
 > port 22 is special case we keep it even if edited or deleted.

### Changing Disks

 - Removing disk from blueprint `disk` section will detach the disk from the machine.
 - Adding new disk in the blueprint will create a new disk and attach it to the machine, then set its IO limit.
 - Removing boot disks will be ignored.

## User access rights

Use the uservdc parameter to specify the user access right to the machine. Note that if only name exist in the entry(no accesstype) then the access right will be by default `ACDRUX`.

Note that the data in the blueprint is always reflected in the machine, which means that removing an entry in the blueprint will remove or change it in the machine. If the user only wants to edit some data then it is possible to do so by using processChange action.

Using process change it is possible to add, remove and update user access to machine. To add user after executing the run and creating the machine, add a new user in the blueprint and execute the blueprint to trigger process change and add new user to the machine or removing user by deleting the entry in the blueprint. Changing the accesstype will update the user access when executing the blueprint and as above removing it will change the access right to the default value `ACDRUX`.

### Access rights

For information about the different access rights check docs at [openvcloud](https://github.com/0-complexity/openvcloud/blob/2.1.7/docs/EndUserPortal/Authorization/AuthorizationModel.md).

## Example for cloning machine

Executing the following blueprint will create a clone of the machine `demo` with name `demo_clone` in the same cloudspace.

```yaml
g8client__env:
    url: '<env_url>'
    login: '<login>'
    password: '<password>'
    account: '<account>'

  cloneName: 'demo_clone'

actions:
  - action: clone
    actor: node.ovc
    service: demo
```

## Example for attaching new disks
If you need to attach disks to an already created machine you can execute a blueprint with the node adding to it all new disks.
The following example attaches a new disk `disk2` to the machine called `demo`.
```yaml
disk.ovc__disk2:
  size: 7

node.ovc__demo:
    disk:
      - 'disk1' # MUST be there to avoid detaching it
      - 'disk2'
```

## Example for detaching disks
If you need to detach disks from an already created machine you can execute a blueprint with the node removed from it the disks you need to detach:
The following example detaches `disk2` which was attached to node `demo` in the previous example, and leave `disk1` attached as it is.

```yaml
node.ovc__demo:
    disk:
      - 'disk1'
```
